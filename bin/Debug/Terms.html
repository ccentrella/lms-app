	<h1>End User License Agreement</h1>
	<p>In order to continue, you must read and accept these terms:</p>
	<p>
		Autosoft is not responsible for any error that your computer may incur.
		<strong>
			Autosoft shall not be responsible for any damage done to your computer,
			whether accidental or incidental, even if Autosoft knew or should have known the problem.
			Even if one of these terms is violated by Autosoft, all other terms will still apply.
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Like all new paid public Autosoft programs, this program features the current Application Lifecycle Policy.
		Per our application lifecycle policy, this version must include a minimum of three year security support.
		In addition, this program features all-time program-related assistance. Though there is no cost to install
		the program, Autosoft makes money every time someone creates an account, which is required to use this program.
	</p>
	<p>
		By activating your account, you agree that you have paid Autosoft the price requested, which is $2.50 at the
		time when this document was made, but is subject to change. Those who attempt to create an account without
		payment are liable to severe punishments as per U.S. policies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Autosoft respects your privacy. However, Autosoft is not responsible for any information sent to them from this
		program. All sensitive information, however, will not be shared, as per the U. S. government laws.
